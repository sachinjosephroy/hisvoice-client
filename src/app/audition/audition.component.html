            <h3>Preparing for the Audition...</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row ">
            <p>It's important to remember that we're not looking for a fully-trained chorister at the auditions! Instead, we look for an enthusiasm for music (and, in particular, singing), reasonable concentration, and supportive family.</p>
            <p>As part of the audition, you will be asked to sing something that you are comfortable with. This can be a simple song, even a hymn â€“ just something you enjoy singing. The Choir Director will then ask you to sing that song in varying tempos
                and pitches to evaluate you on your vocal range and other parameters.
            </p>
            <p>If you play a musical instrument, then we would like to hear you play a short piece of your choosing.</p>
            <p>Above all, we are looking for enthusiasm and committment, and the passion to sing Christian music in harmony. We believe that we can train anyone to sing along beautifully, and blend in with the group as long as you have the ability to sing
                in a given pitch and tempo.</p>
